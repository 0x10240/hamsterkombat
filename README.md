# Latest update (Summary) // 04-07-2024
These changes enhance the script by adding a maximum price filter for upgrades, refining the upgrade process to avoid unnecessary error messages, and improving error handling in the buy_upgrade function. These updates ensure a smoother and more efficient upgrading experience in the Hamster Kombat Clicker game.

The updated code introduces a max_price variable, setting it to 8 million. The filter now ensures that the upgrades are not only affordable but also within a maximum price limit of 5 million = 5000000.

  ```bash
max_price = 5000000
upgrades_sorted = [u for u in upgrades if u['price'] <= balance_coins and u['price'] <= max_price]
  ```
